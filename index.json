The goal of the team is to look for new algorithms to improve the performances of Pepper and Nao. We worked on AI related problems (speech recognition, visiual recognition) and robotics related problems (grasping).\nBefore working in the industry, I worked in multiple laboratories on the use of learning algorithms for multi-agent systems. I targeted the challenges arising when agents have to adapt to the environment, and produce a satisfying behaviour at the level of the population.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"598b63dd58b43bce02403646f240cd3c","permalink":"//localhost:1313/authors/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/admin/","section":"author","summary":"I\u0026rsquo;m Jean-Marc Montanier, a Data Scientist, currently working at Faurecia at the DSF team.\nCurrent work The DSF team of Faurecia tackles two broad problems:\n Improve the production (speed and quality) Improve the products (functionalities)  We focus on the subset of problems that can be addressed by Machine Learning and A.I. tools.
